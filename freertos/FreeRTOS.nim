##  Include the generic headers required for the FreeRTOS port being used.

##
##  If stdint.h cannot be located then:
##    + If using GCC ensure the -nostdint options is *not* being used.
##    + Ensure the project's include path includes the directory in which your
##      compiler stores stdint.h.
##    + Set any compiler options necessary for it to support C99, as technically
##      stdint.h is only mandatory with C99 (FreeRTOS does not require C99 in any
##      other way).
##    + The FreeRTOS download includes a simple stdint.h definition that can be
##      used in cases where none is provided by the compiler.  The files only
##      contains the typedefs required to build FreeRTOS.  Read the instructions
##      in FreeRTOS/source/stdint.readme for more information.
